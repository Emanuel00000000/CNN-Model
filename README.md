# COMPLEX CNN MODEL
I made this code as my final proyect for the BootCamp of DataScience by Ibaktor School of Executive Education, where I used VGG16 model, then used a Extra Trees Classifier for selecting the predicted data by the VGG16 model and finish with a MLP model.
The MLP has a entry layer which size is the selected data from the Extras Trees Classifier and 2 hidden layer, 128 and 64 neurons both 'relu' activation and the output layet of the amount classes extracted from the dataset and 'softmax' activation.
